# README

Bootrails Blocks is a Bootstrap v5 theme for Ruby-on-Rails.


## What's inside

It relies on Webpack(er), and standard, last-version of Bootstrap v5.

The core SCSS of Bootstrap is left "as-is" in order to support version upgrade, and to stick with Bootstrap awesome productivity.

Customization is achieved through :

 - One global SCSS file, whose primary goal is to set up Bootstrap's SaSS variables,
 - One tiny SCSS file per "block"

It includes :

 - Beautiful, modern, elegant theme
 - Open-source, PR and insights are welcome
 - Integration with Hotwire and Turbo for forms
 - Integration with Toasts messages

## Philosophy

Bootstrap is perfect when you have to ship quickly and you have no designer. Tailwind is awesome. I'm aware the Rails community is now using Tailwind a lot, however it comes with many limitations, notably the lack of dynamic UI components.

The good news is : the very last version of Bootstrap (v5) is heavily inspired from Tailwind, so you can have the best of both world.
